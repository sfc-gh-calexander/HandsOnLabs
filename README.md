## Quick Start — Cortex Code Labs

### Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN (or CREATE DATABASE privileges)
- Cortex Code CLI installed ([Install Guide](2-Cortex-Code/CoCo%20Install/README.md))

### Setup

In Cortex Code CLI:
```
Fetch and execute the setup script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebaalexander/HandsOnLabs/main/2-Cortex-Code/setup/CoCo_PawCore_Setup.sql to set up the PawCore environment. Proceed autonomously — when prompted for SQL permissions, allow all statements in PAWCORE_ANALYTICS.
```

Or copy the setup script into a Snowsight worksheet and Run All.

### Labs

| Lab | Time | Format | What You Build |
|-----|------|--------|---------------|
| [CoCo CLI](2-Cortex-Code/CoCo%20CLI/) | ~30 min | Terminal + slides | Semantic View, Cortex Agent, custom skill, stakeholder documentation |
| [CoCo UI](2-Cortex-Code/CoCo%20UI/) | ~33 min | Snowsight browser | Screenshot repair, notebook, Dynamic Table, Streamlit app, Intelligence agent |
| [CoCo Install](2-Cortex-Code/CoCo%20Install/) | ~10 min | Setup guide | CLI installation, authentication, Snowsight enablement |

## Data Story

PawCore is preparing to launch SmartCollar V2. Both labs use the same underlying data but ask different questions:

| Lab | Persona | Key Question |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Cortex AI and SI | Engineering / QA | "What caused the quality issues?" (LOT341) |
| CoCo CLI | Rina Vasquez (VP Product) | "Are we ready to launch V2? Which region first?" |
| CoCo UI | Marcus Thompson (CX Lead) | "Is our support team ready for V2 launch volume?" |
